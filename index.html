<h1 class='mb-3'>Hello!</h1>
<p>
  Welcome to the <strong>Algorithmic Composition Explorer</strong>! I built this site as part of my thesis for the <a class='' href='https://www.uio.no/english/studies/programmes/mct-master/'>Music Communication Technology</a> masters degree I took at the University of Oslo between 2020-2022.
</p>
<h4>So what's this all about then?</h4>
<p>For those that have the time and motivation, there are many good libraries and environments for learning algorithmic music and creating compositional systems. For those that have little or no programming knowledge, or those that just want to get a tactile understanding and feel for a selection of different algorithmic approaches without having to build their own system from scratch, there are few options. This project is an attempt at filling that gap.</p>
<p>My main aim was to build a system that could offer an introduction to algorithmic thinking in music, and hopefully to inspire you to dig a bit deeper. Algorithmic composition doesn't have to involve being able to code or do advanced mathematics. It can just be a way to come up with new musical ideas and break out of a creative rut.</p>
<p>For those that do like to code, the source for this website can be found on <a href=''>Github</a>. Feel free to contribute!</p>
