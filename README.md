# The Algorithmic Composition Explorer

For those that have the time and motivation, there are many good libraries and environments for learning algorithmic music and creating compositional systems. For those that have little or no programming knowledge, or those that just want to get a tactile understanding and feel for a selection of different algorithmic approaches without having to build their own system from scratch, there are few options. This project is an attempt at filling that gap.

My main aim was to build a system that could offer an introduction to algorithmic thinking in music, and hopefully to inspire people to dig a bit deeper. Algorithmic composition doesn't have to involve being able to code or do advanced mathematics. It can just be a way to come up with new musical ideas and break out of a creative rut.

This is a project I developed during my masters degree in [Music, Communication and Technology](https://www.uio.no/english/studies/programmes/mct-master/) at the University of Oslo.

The tool can be found at https://ace.stephengardener.com, and you can read more about it [here](https://stephengardener.com/projects/ace/).
