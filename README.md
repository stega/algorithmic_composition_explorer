# The Algorithmic Composition Explorer

This is a project I developed during my masters degree in [Music, Communication and Technology](https://www.uio.no/english/studies/programmes/mct-master/) at University of Oslo.

The app can be found at https://algorithmic-composition-explorer.com, and you can read more about it [here](https://mct-master.github.io/masters-thesis/2022/05/15/stephedg-algorithmic-composition-explorer.html).
